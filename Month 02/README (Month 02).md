# Task 18: Introduction to Seaborn - Visualization with Seaborn 📊

In this task, I explored the basics of data visualization using Seaborn, a popular Python library built on top of Matplotlib. I learned about various types of plots offered by Seaborn, including:

- Scatter Plots ✨
- Line Plots 📈
- Bar Plots 📊
- Count Plots 📑
- Box Plots 📦

I practiced creating these plots using different datasets and customized them to enhance their appearance and readability. Additionally, I learned how to set the style of the plots using `sns.set_style()`, add titles and labels, and change the color palette to suit my needs. This experience has equipped me with the skills to effectively communicate insights and patterns in data using Seaborn's visualization tools. 🎨

# Task 19: Statistical Plotting with Seaborn 📈

In this task, I delved into statistical plotting with Seaborn, expanding my data visualization toolkit. I focused on creating and customizing various types of statistical plots that are essential for data analysis and interpretation.

## Regression Plots
- **Linear Regression Plot** (`sns.regplot`) 📏
- **Multiple Linear Regression Plot** (`sns.lmplot`) 📊
- **Residual Plot** (`sns.residplot`) 📉

## Distribution Plots
- **Histogram** (`sns.histplot`) 📊
- **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plot** (`sns.kdeplot`) 📈
- **Distribution Plot** (`sns.distplot`) 📉
- **Box Plot** (`sns.boxplot`) 📦
- **Violin Plot** (`sns.violinplot`) 🎻
- **Pair Plot** (`sns.pairplot`) 🔀

## Multivariate Plots
- **Heatmap** (`sns.heatmap`) 🌡️
- **Joint Plot** (`sns.jointplot`) 🔗
- **Facet Grid** (`sns.FacetGrid`) 🗂️

### What I Have Done
I practiced creating these plots using different datasets and tailored them to improve their interpretability and aesthetics. By doing so, I gained proficiency in effectively using Seaborn to visualize and analyze statistical relationships and distributions in data.

This task has enhanced my ability to present data-driven insights through advanced statistical visualizations, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. 🎨
