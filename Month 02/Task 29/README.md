# Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques

## Objective
The goal of this task is to select and fine-tune machine learning models to achieve optimal performance. This involves applying hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization to various models from sklearn, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and KNNs.

## Models and Tuning Techniques

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Purpose**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Hyperparameters**: Regularization strength (`alpha` for Ridge and Lasso).
- **Tuning Method**: Grid Search.
  
### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Purpose**: Binary classification.
- **Hyperparameters**: Regularization strength (`C`), penalty (`l1`, `l2`), solver.
- **Tuning Method**: Grid Search and Random Search.
  
### 3. Decision Trees
- **Purpose**: Classification and regression.
- **Hyperparameters**: Maximum depth, minimum samples split, minimum samples leaf, criterion.
- **Tuning Method**: Grid Search.
  
### 4. Random Forests
- **Purpose**: Classification and regression.
- **Hyperparameters**: Number of estimators, maximum depth, minimum samples split, minimum samples leaf, bootstrap.
- **Tuning Method**: Random Search.
  
### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- **Purpose**: Classification and regression.
- **Hyperparameters**: Regularization parameter (`C`), kernel, gamma.
- **Tuning Method**: Grid Search and Random Search.
  
### 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Purpose**: Classification.
- **Hyperparameters**: Number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`), weights, algorithm.
- **Tuning Method**: Grid Search.

## Tuning Methods Explained

### Grid Search
Grid Search exhaustively searches through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space. This method is effective but can be computationally expensive.

### Random Search
Random Search samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from a specified distribution. This approach is less exhaustive but more computationally efficient.

### Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian Optimization is a probabilistic model that builds a surrogate model to predict the performance of hyperparameter configurations and selects new hyperparameters to evaluate.

## Results and Evaluation
The results of the hyperparameter tuning process will be documented, highlighting the best models and hyperparameters identified for each algorithm. The impact of different hyperparameters on model performance will also be evaluated.
