Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to select, modify, or create new features (variables) that enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms. It is a critical step in building effective models, as it directly influences their ability to learn and make accurate predictions. 

In this task, we explored various feature engineering techniques through hands-on experience with the Titanic and Iris datasets. The key steps we covered include:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features by analyzing their correlation with the target variable and using methods like mutual information or chi-squared tests.
2. **Feature Transformation**: Applying transformations such as log transformation, normalization, and standardization to improve model performance.
3. **Feature Creation**: Creating new features by combining or modifying existing ones to provide more information to the model.
4. **Polynomial Features**: Generating polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships using the `PolynomialFeatures` class from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
5. **Handling Categorical Features**: Converting categorical features into numerical features through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.

Each step was performed using practical examples, demonstrating the importance and impact of feature engineering in machine learning. The transformations and encodings were applied to ensure the models could effectively interpret and utilize the data, leading to improved accuracy and performance.
