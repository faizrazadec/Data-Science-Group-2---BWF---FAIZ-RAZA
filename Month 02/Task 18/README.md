# Task 18: Introduction to Seaborn - Visualization with Seaborn ðŸ“Š

In this task, I explored the basics of data visualization using Seaborn, a popular Python library built on top of Matplotlib. I learned about various types of plots offered by Seaborn, including:

- Scatter Plots âœ¨
- Line Plots ðŸ“ˆ
- Bar Plots ðŸ“Š
- Count Plots ðŸ“‘
- Box Plots ðŸ“¦

I practiced creating these plots using different datasets and customized them to enhance their appearance and readability. Additionally, I learned how to set the style of the plots using `sns.set_style()`, add titles and labels, and change the color palette to suit my needs. This experience has equipped me with the skills to effectively communicate insights and patterns in data using Seaborn's visualization tools. ðŸŽ¨
