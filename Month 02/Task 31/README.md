## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques 📉

### Overview 📋

Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to simplify complex datasets, reduce computational costs, and help prevent overfitting in machine learning models. In this task, various dimensionality reduction methods were applied to a high-dimensional dataset to observe their impact on model performance.

### Techniques Applied ⚙️

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Transforms data into principal components that explain the greatest variance. 📊

2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**:
   - Finds linear combinations of features that best separate classes. 📏

3. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**:
   - A non-linear technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. 🌐

4. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**:
   - Separates a multivariate signal into independent components. 🧩

5. **Feature Selection Methods**:
   - **SelectKBest**: Selects the top k features based on statistical tests. 🎯
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removes less important features to select the best subset. 🔄

### Application and Evaluation 📊

A high-dimensional dataset was used to demonstrate the impact of these techniques. Machine learning models were trained on the dataset before and after applying dimensionality reduction to observe changes in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comparison highlighted the effectiveness of each technique in improving model performance.
