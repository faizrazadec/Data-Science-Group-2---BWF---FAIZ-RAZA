## Data Preprocessing with Scikit-learn 🧩

### Overview 📋

This task involved the preprocessing of data using scikit-learn to prepare it for machine learning models. The preprocessing steps included scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and imputing missing values. Post-preprocessing, various machine learning models were applied, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize these models.

### Preprocessing Steps ⚙️

1. **Scaling Features**: 
   - Used `StandardScaler` to standardize numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance. 📏

2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: 
   - Applied `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical features into binary variables. 🔄

3. **Imputing Missing Values**: 
   - Utilized `SimpleImputer` to fill in missing values in the dataset. 🧩

### Machine Learning Models Applied 🤖

1. **Linear Regression** 📉
2. **Logistic Regression** 📊
3. **Random Forest** 🌳

### Hyperparameter Tuning 🎯

- **Grid Search**: Conducted a comprehensive search over specified parameter values for the Random Forest model. 🔍
- **Random Search**: Performed a randomized search over parameters to find the best combination for the Random Forest model. 🎲

### Evaluation 📊

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 📈
