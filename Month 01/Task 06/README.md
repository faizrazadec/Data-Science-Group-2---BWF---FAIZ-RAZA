### Task 06: Student Data and Library Book Management Applications 📚

🔍 **Overview**:
- Developed two separate applications: one for managing student data and another for managing a library book collection.
- Each application provides functionalities to add, search, delete, and display records, as well as borrow and return books in the library application.

📄 **Documentation**:
- **Student Data Application**: This application allows users to manage student records, including adding new students, searching for students by ID, deleting students, and displaying all student data.
- **Library Book Management Application**: This application enables users to manage book records, including adding new books, searching for books by ID, borrowing and returning books, and displaying all book data.

The code for both applications ensures data persistence by saving records to text files and reloading them when the program starts. Each application is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear prompts and feedback throughout the interaction.
