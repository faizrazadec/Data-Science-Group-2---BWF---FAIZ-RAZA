# 📊 Data Science Group 2 - BWF - Faiz Raza

Welcome to the repository for all the tasks, mini-projects, and mega-projects assigned by Bytewise during the Data Science Fellowship. This document will guide you through the various tasks and concepts covered.

### Task 04: Python Basics (Variable, Datatypes, Operators) 🐍

🔍 **Overview**:
- Began exploring the fundamentals of Python programming.
- Learned about variables, data types, and operators.
- Understood how to use Python for basic arithmetic operations and variable manipulation.

📄 **Documentation**:
- Create a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating your understanding of Python basics.
- Include examples of different data types, variable assignments, and operators.
- Place the notebook in a folder named `Task 4` and add it to the repository.

## Practical Applications

### Simple DMAS Calculator 🧮

**Project Description**:
Create a program that prompts the user to input two numbers. The program will then calculate and display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

**Calculator Program Overview**:
Hi there! This program is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. You can use it to add, subtract, multiply, divide, calculate the modulus (remainder), and even exponentiation!

**DMAS Order**:
- **D** - Division
- **M** - Multiplication
- **A** - Addition
- **S** - Subtraction

**How to Use the Calculator**:
1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the operator you want to use.
3. Enter the second number.

**Available Operators**:
- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `/` for division
- `*` for multiplication
- `**` for exponentiation (e.g., `2 ** 3` for 2 to the power of 3)
- `%` for modulus (remainder)

Let's get started! Enter the first number.

### Unit Conversion Program 🔄

**Supported Units**:
The program can convert between the following units of length:
- Meters (m)
- Feet (ft)
- Kilometers (km)
- Miles (mi)
- Yards (yd)
- Inches (in)

**How to Use**:
To convert between units, simply:
1. Enter the value you want to convert.
2. Enter the from unit (the unit you want to convert from).
3. Enter the to unit (the unit you want to convert to).
