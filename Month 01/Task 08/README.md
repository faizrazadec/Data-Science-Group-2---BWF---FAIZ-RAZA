# Inventory Management System

## Introduction

The Inventory Management System is a Python application designed to manage products, categories, and stock levels. The system allows users to add products, update stock levels, and display products by category.

## Goals

* Create a Python application that uses data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples) to manage inventory.
* Implement functions to add products, update stock levels, and display products.
* Use classes to define Product and Inventory objects.
* Demonstrate understanding of Python data structures and object-oriented programming.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Basic understanding of Python data structures and object-oriented programming

## Tasks

* Define data structures to store product information
* Implement functions to add products, update stock levels, and display products
* Use classes to define Product and Inventory objects
* Test the application with sample data

## Deliverables

* A Python script (`inventory.py`) that implements the Inventory Management System
* A Markdown file (`intro.md`) that introduces the task and provides an overview of the application
* A sample data file (`data.txt`) that contains product information
