# NumPy Tasks
## Introduction

📚 This project demonstrates proficiency in using NumPy for various array operations and statistical calculations. The tasks cover:

📝 Creating arrays of different dimensions
🤖 Performing element-wise operations
📊 Calculating dot product, mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient
📈 Generating random numbers from normal and uniform distributions
🎲 Simulating a random process (rolling a die)

🔍 Practical Application: We applied these NumPy skills to build a Matrix Calculator that performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices, and also calculates statistics and simulates random processes.
