# Task 05: If Conditions, For Loops, While Loops, and Functions using Python

## Overview
In this task, we will practice using if conditions, for loops, while loops, and functions by creating various patterns and performing mathematical computations. This task will help solidify our understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.

## Subtasks

#### Task 5.1: Right-Angled Triangle of Stars

🔍 **Description**:
We will create a function that prints a right-angled triangle made of stars (`*`). The number of rows of the triangle will be determined by the user.

📄 **Function Definition**:
- The function `right_angled_triangle(rows)` will take one argument `rows`, which defines the number of rows in the triangle.
- It will use a `for` loop to print the triangle row by row.

📄 **Example**:
For `rows = 5`, the output should be:

🔍 **Description**:
We will create a function that prints an inverted right-angled triangle made of stars (`*`). The number of rows of the triangle will be determined by the user.

📄 **Function Definition**:
- The function `inverted_triangle(rows)` will take one argument `rows`, which defines the number of rows in the triangle.
- It will use a `for` loop to print the triangle row by row in inverted form.

📄 **Example**:
For `rows = 5`, the output should be:
