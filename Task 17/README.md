# Data Visualization Tasks

### Overview
In this task, I learned advanced plotting techniques using Matplotlib, including subplots, histograms, and box plots. I created various plots to visualize data, customizing them with titles, axis labels, legends, and colors.

### Tasks

#### Subplots

* **Subplot Figure**: Generate a figure with 2x2 subplots, each containing a different type of plot (e.g., line plot, scatter plot, bar plot, and histogram) 📊.
* **Customization**: Customize the subplots with titles, axis labels, and legends 🎨.

#### Histograms

* **Basic Histogram**: Create a histogram for a given numerical data set 📊.
* **Customization**: Customize the number of bins and plot multiple histograms on the same figure to compare different data sets 📊.
* **Normalization**: Normalize the histograms and add appropriate labels and titles 📝.

#### Box Plots

* **Basic Box Plot**: Create a box plot for a given numerical data set 📈.
* **Multiple Box Plots**: Generate multiple box plots in a single figure to compare different data sets 📊.
* **Customization**: Customize the box plots with titles, labels, and change the colors 🎨.

### Summary
This task helped me master advanced plotting techniques, enabling me to create informative and visually appealing plots to effectively communicate insights and patterns in data. 📊
